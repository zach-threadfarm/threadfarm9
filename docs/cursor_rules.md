# Cursor Rules for Threadfarm Build

âœ… Use only Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind, Supabase â€“ no extra frameworks.  
âœ… Follow `.md` task lists â€“ do not skip verification for each step.  
âœ… Use dummy data in Phase 1, real data in Phase 3.  
âœ… All UI must match the provided images for consistency.  
âœ… Keep code modular and direct â€“ no over-abstraction.  
âœ… Each task must include: file(s), UI element, test/verify step.  
âœ… Sidebar nav and stepper must be present on all relevant pages.  
âœ… PostCard must handle: edit, reorder, add images, consistent style.  
âœ… Donâ€™t create new folders/files unless absolutely needed.  
âœ… Document how to test every feature â€“ clear for non-coders.  

This ensures we donâ€™t miss critical details and the build is direct and testable. Letâ€™s make sure this version is the final one that **works this time!** ðŸš€
